# Delivery Service

### How to run
run ```yarn dev``` and open http://localhost:3000

run ```yarn test``` to run the tests

## Note:
There is not validation done for the fields, neither case sensitivity check. 
I didn't consider it part of the task.
Please put the values as they are given in the example:

Case 1: "A-B" or "A-B-E"

Case 2: Please prefill the maximum stops (if wished) and maximum cost. 
The routes this time should be strictly 1-1 (E-E, E-D, E-B) and not like in case 1 (A-B-E).

For more tests, you can always add more routes in the UI (AD1, AC4, EM7)...
